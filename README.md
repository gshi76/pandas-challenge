# pandas-challenge 
For this challenge, I used the following resources: my peers, learning assistance, office hours and ChatGPT
I collaborated with Paola, Astrid and Zach on this challenge and therefore may have similarities in code. 
I attended office hours with Mark and Paveen who helped me debug my code and so parts of my assignment were written with assistance from them.
ChatGPT was used to provide examples that helped me grasp the concept of how to utilize Panda functions
